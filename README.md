This project is my personal web page created as part of an HTML, CSS, and OpenLayers assignment. The purpose of this work is to demonstrate my understanding of web development fundamentals such as page structure with HTML, styling and animations with CSS, and the integration of OpenLayers to display an interactive map.

On this website, I introduced myself . The site includes smooth animations, organized sections, and a simple, modern design that reflects both my personal style and technical learning throughout this project.
